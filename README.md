# Solid-Dollop Memory Card Game

## The purpose of this project is to create a memory card game that allows for the user to interact with the computure in a classic memory card game. The user is given a set of cards in which they have the oportunity to flip over and find a matching pair.

- What was your motivation? The motivation of this project is to help understand and attribute concepts learned from the course and apply them to a real life scenario.
  
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") We wanted to build this project to have a unique project that allowed us to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScipt properties that we have exercised through up to this point.
  
- What problem does it solve? The problem solved from this project was the lack of games that have been developed using local storage.
  
- What did you learn? During the development of this game, one of the biggest impacts made onto our knowledge was the use of github in a real world setting, collaborating with other developers on the same project, in and out of zoom calls. Furthermore, this project challenged our html, css, and javascript skills up to this point, and allowed us to learn how all the concepts we have learned can be used in unison to achieve the purpose of game development.
