# Solid-Dollop Memory Card Game


## The purpose of this project is to create a memory card game that allows for the user to interact with the computer in a classic memory card game. 


- What was your motivation? The motivation of this project is to help understand and attribute concepts learned from the course and apply them to a real life scenario.
 
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") We wanted to build this project to have a unique project that allowed us to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript properties that we have exercised through up to this point.
 
- What problem does it solve? The problem solved from this project was the lack of games that have been developed using local storage.
 
- What did you learn? During the development of this game, one of the biggest impacts made onto our knowledge was the use of github in a real world setting, collaborating with other developers on the same project, in and out of zoom calls. Furthermore, this project challenged our html, css, and javascript skills up to this point, and allowed us to learn how all the concepts we have learned can be used in unison to achieve the purpose of game development.

## Concept


In beginning to brainstorm ideas for our project in what we wanted to develop, we considered multiple options. As mentioned in the project details, we needed a webpage that incorporates concepts that have been learned all the way up to this point during the first month and a half of the course, through thorough HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that includes locally stored information, as well as a modal for whatever we so chose. An initial thought we considered had been a storefront to hold client side information and host the experience one would have traditionally shopping online, and while that would have been applicable, we settled on this card game! 'Solid-Dollop' (the default name given to our repository on creation) is a card game that allows the user to search for matching pairs in an array of hidden cards. The game modes include three different pre-selected arrays that give the user an assortment of different difficulty options to play, whilst tracking player data in local storage.




## Features


Features in Software Development, according to CMU, are "a unit of functionality of a software system that satisfies a requirement, represents a design decision, and provides a potential configuration option," meaning something that allows the user to have their own individual experience on the web page. With this in mind, our card game has multiple different features that the user can (and will) interact with upon using the website. One feature that is immediately accessed by the user is the difficulty selection feature, which alters the amount of cards displayed on the board at a given time. The next feature includes the capabilities of being able to flip over the cards to check to see if their values match or are separate from one another. Furthermore, upon completion of the board, the user is allowed an option to play again or return to the home screen, where they can access their player stats using the modal button featured on the home page.
